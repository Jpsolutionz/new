========================================
   ERROR FOUND!
========================================

ERROR MESSAGE:
"This request has been automatically failed 
because it uses a deprecated version of 
actions/upload-artifact: v3"

WHAT THIS MEANS:
GitHub stopped supporting upload-artifact@v3
We need to use v4 instead

========================================
   THE FIX
========================================

The workflow file on your PC already has v4!
But GitHub might have an old version with v3.

SOLUTION:
Push the updated workflow file again

========================================
   RUN THIS NOW
========================================

👉 FIX_ARTIFACT_ERROR.bat

This will:
1. Add the workflow file (with v4)
2. Commit it
3. Push to GitHub
4. Trigger a new build

========================================
   WHAT WILL HAPPEN
========================================

After running the bat file:

1. Go to: https://github.com/Jpsolutionz/new/actions

2. You'll see a NEW build starting

3. This time it should work because:
   ✓ Using upload-artifact@v4 (not v3)
   ✓ Using checkout@v4
   ✓ Using setup-node@v4
   ✓ Using setup-java@v4

4. Wait 10-15 minutes

5. If it still fails, we'll see a DIFFERENT error
   (not the artifact v3 error)

========================================
   IF IT STILL FAILS
========================================

If you see a different error after this fix:
1. Click on the failed build
2. Look for the step with red X
3. Tell me the new error message

Common next errors might be:
- "expo: command not found"
- "npm ERR! code ERESOLVE"
- "Android folder not found"
- "Gradle build failed"

========================================

RUN: FIX_ARTIFACT_ERROR.bat
