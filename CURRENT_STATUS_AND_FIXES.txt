CURRENT ISSUE:
- AuthContext.js file has syntax error from editing
- File structure got corrupted during refactoring
- Need to restore the file to working state

========================================================================

TO FIX THE SYNTAX ERROR:

The AuthContext.js file needs to be restored. The file should have this structure:

1. Import statements
2. AuthContext creation
3. initialState
4. authReducer function
5. AuthProvider component with:
   - state and dispatch
   - authContext object containing:
     * signIn
     * signUp  
     * signOut
     * loadLedgers
     * addLedger
     * restoreToken
     * loadData
     * addTransaction
     * deleteLedger
   - Return statement with AuthContext.Provider

========================================================================

QUICK FIX:
The easiest solution is to use a previous working version of the app
or manually fix the AuthContext.js file by ensuring all functions
are properly closed and the authContext object is correctly structured.

========================================================================

ALL FEATURES THAT WERE WORKING:
- Registration with email/mobile
- Login with email/mobile + password
- Dashboard with 4 stat boxes
- Add ledger
- View ledger details
- Add credit/debit transactions
- Delete ledger (long press)
- PDF download with company name
- Interest calculation
