========================================
   DON'T PANIC! EASY FIX!
========================================

WHAT HAPPENED:
The workflow files got removed from GitHub

WHERE ARE THEY:
They're still on your PC!
Location: .github/workflows/build-android.yml

========================================
   QUICK FIX
========================================

Run this file:
👉 🎯_FIX_WORKFLOW_NOW.bat

This will:
1. Add the workflow files back
2. Push them to GitHub
3. Restore everything!

========================================
   AFTER RUNNING THE BAT FILE
========================================

1. Go to: https://github.com/Jpsolutionz/new/actions

2. You'll see the workflows are back!

3. A new build will start automatically

4. Wait 10-15 minutes

5. If it fails, we'll see the REAL error
   (not the v3 artifact error anymore)

========================================
   WHY THIS HAPPENED
========================================

The old workflow file (build-apk.yml) had v3
We tried to delete it
But it removed all workflows from GitHub

The files are SAFE on your PC!
We just need to push them back!

========================================

RUN: 🎯_FIX_WORKFLOW_NOW.bat
