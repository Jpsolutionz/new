========================================
   GOOD NEWS: WORKFLOW IS RUNNING!
========================================

✓ You pushed the workflow successfully!
✓ GitHub is running the builds!
✗ But they're failing with red X

========================================
   NOW WE NEED TO SEE THE ERROR
========================================

STEP 1: Click on any of the failed builds
        (The ones that say "Update workflow: Use expo prebuild...")

STEP 2: You'll see a list of steps like:
        ✓ Checkout code
        ✓ Setup Node.js
        ✓ Install dependencies
        ❌ Setup Expo and create Android folder  <-- RED X HERE
        
STEP 3: Click on the step with the RED X

STEP 4: You'll see the error message

========================================
   WHAT TO LOOK FOR
========================================

Common errors:

ERROR 1: "expo: command not found"
→ Expo CLI not installed properly

ERROR 2: "npm ERR! code ERESOLVE"
→ Dependency conflict

ERROR 3: "Error: expo prebuild failed"
→ Missing configuration

ERROR 4: "Android folder not created"
→ Prebuild didn't work

ERROR 5: "Gradle build failed"
→ Build configuration issue

========================================
   WHAT TO DO NOW
========================================

1. Click on one of the failed builds (red X)

2. Look for the step with red X

3. Click on it to expand

4. Copy the error message

5. Tell me:
   - Which step failed?
   - What's the error message?

Then I can create the exact fix!

========================================
   EXAMPLE OF WHAT YOU'LL SEE
========================================

If you click on the failed build, you might see:

Run npm install -g expo-cli
npm ERR! code EACCES
npm ERR! permission denied

OR

Run npx expo prebuild --platform android
Error: Cannot find module 'expo'

OR

Run ./gradlew assembleRelease
Task :app:compileReleaseJavaWithJavac FAILED

========================================

Just copy the error and tell me!
