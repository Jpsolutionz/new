========================================
👆 DO THESE 2 THINGS NOW
========================================

THING 1: Click on the TOP build
         (the first one in the list)
         
         It says something like:
         "Fix workflow: use React Native CLI..."
         
         👆 CLICK IT

THING 2: Look for RED X (❌)
         
         You'll see a list of steps.
         One of them has a RED X.
         
         Tell me which one!

========================================
THAT'S IT!
========================================

Just do those 2 things and tell me:

"The step with RED X is: [name]"

Then I can fix it!

========================================
EXAMPLE
========================================

You might say:
"The step with RED X is: Install dependencies"

Or:
"The step with RED X is: Create Android folder"

Or:
"The step with RED X is: Build APK"

========================================
CAN'T FIND IT?
========================================

Just tell me what you see on the screen
after you click the top build!

I'll help you find it!
