========================================
   WHY THE BUILD IS FAILING
========================================

ERROR MESSAGE:
"This request has been automatically failed 
because it uses a deprecated version of 
actions/upload-artifact: v3"

========================================
   ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
========================================

FACT 1: Your local file has v4
File: .github/workflows/build-android.yml
Line 50: uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4

FACT 2: GitHub sees v3
The error says it's using v3

FACT 3: There were multiple workflow files
- build-android.yml (has v4) ✓
- build-apk.yml (had v3) ✗ DELETED
- build-with-expo.yml (uses EAS, no artifact)

========================================
   WHY GITHUB STILL SEES V3
========================================

POSSIBILITY 1: File not pushed
The build-android.yml with v4 never reached GitHub

POSSIBILITY 2: Wrong file running
GitHub is running an old cached version

POSSIBILITY 3: Another file exists
There's another workflow on GitHub we don't see locally

========================================
   HOW TO VERIFY
========================================

Go to GitHub and check:
https://github.com/Jpsolutionz/new/tree/master/.github/workflows

Look at the files there:
1. How many workflow files exist?
2. Click on build-android.yml
3. Look at line 50 - does it say v3 or v4?

========================================
   WHAT WE KNOW FOR SURE
========================================

✓ Local file has v4 (I verified this)
✗ GitHub is running v3 (error proves this)
? The v4 file hasn't reached GitHub yet

========================================
   THE SOLUTION
========================================

We need to:
1. Make sure build-android.yml is committed
2. Push it to GitHub
3. Verify it's there with v4
4. Delete any old workflow files on GitHub

========================================
   NEXT STEP
========================================

Before running any bat file, let's check:

1. What does GitHub show?
   Go to: https://github.com/Jpsolutionz/new/tree/master/.github/workflows
   
2. How many files are there?

3. What's inside build-android.yml on GitHub?
   (Click on it and check line 50)

Tell me what you see, then we'll know
exactly what to fix!
