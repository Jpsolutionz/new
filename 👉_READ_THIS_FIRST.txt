========================================
WHICH ONE SHOULD YOU CHOOSE?
========================================

Choose A if:
- You want the easiest way
- You don't mind using Expo's website
- You want to build manually when needed

Choose B if:
- You want automatic builds
- You want builds on every push
- You prefer GitHub over Expo

========================================
BOTH WORK WITHOUT CLI!
========================================

Neither option needs:
❌ React Native CLI
❌ npm on your PC
❌ Terminal commands
❌ Android Studio

Both are 100% cloud-based!

========================================
WHAT TO DO NOW
========================================

1. Decide: A or B?

2. If A (Expo Cloud):
   → Read: ⚡_EXPO_CLOUD_BUILD_GUIDE.txt
