🔧 COMMON GITHUB ACTIONS ERRORS
========================================

Once you tell me which step failed, here's
what the fix will be:

========================================
ERROR 1: Install dependencies
========================================

Step name: "Install dependencies"

Common error messages:
- "npm ERR! code ERESOLVE"
- "npm ERR! peer dependency"
- "npm ERR! ENOENT"

FIX: Update package.json to fix dependencies

========================================
ERROR 2: Setup Expo and create Android folder
========================================

Step name: "Setup Expo and create Android folder"

Common error messages:
- "expo: command not found"
- "expo prebuild failed"
- "Android folder creation failed"

FIX: Update workflow to install expo-cli properly

========================================
ERROR 3: Make Gradlew executable
========================================

Step name: "Make Gradlew executable"

Common error messages:
- "chmod: cannot access 'android/gradlew'"
- "No such file or directory"

FIX: Android folder wasn't created properly

========================================
ERROR 4: Build Android Release APK
========================================

Step name: "Build Android Release APK"

Common error messages:
- "Gradle build failed"
- "Task :app:assembleRelease FAILED"
- "Could not find com.android.tools.build:gradle"

FIX: Update gradle configuration or dependencies

========================================
ERROR 5: Upload APK
========================================

Step name: "Upload APK"

Common error messages:
- "No files were found with the provided path"
- "APK not found"

FIX: APK wasn't built, need to fix build step

========================================
MOST LIKELY ERRORS
========================================

Based on your previous builds, it's probably:

1. Install dependencies (npm install fails)
   → Fix: Update package.json

2. Setup Expo and create Android folder
   → Fix: Use expo prebuild correctly

3. Build Android Release APK
   → Fix: Gradle configuration

========================================
WHAT I NEED FROM YOU
========================================

Just tell me:

"The step with RED X is: [step name]"

Then I'll create the EXACT fix for that error!

========================================
WHY MULTIPLE BUILDS FAILED
========================================

You have 8 failed builds because:

1. First build: Had one error
2. I fixed that error
3. Second build: Hit a DIFFERENT error
4. I fixed that error
5. Third build: Hit ANOTHER error
6. And so on...

This is NORMAL! Each fix reveals the next issue.

We're getting closer with each build!

========================================
CURRENT STATUS
========================================

Latest workflow file uses:
- expo prebuild (most reliable method)
- actions/upload-artifact@v4 (latest version)
- Proper Java setup
- Correct gradle commands

This SHOULD work, but we need to see
which step is failing to confirm!

========================================
NEXT STEPS
========================================

1. You: Click top build, find RED X step
2. You: Tell me which step has RED X
3. Me: Create targeted fix
4. You: Run 🔥_FINAL_FIX_GITHUB.bat
5. Wait 10-15 minutes
6. Download APK!
