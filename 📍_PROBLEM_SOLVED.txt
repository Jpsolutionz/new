========================================
   PROBLEM FOUND AND FIXED!
========================================

THE ISSUE:
You had TWO workflow files in .github/workflows/

1. build-android.yml ✓ (GOOD)
   - Uses upload-artifact@v4
   - Uses expo prebuild
   - This is the one we want!

2. build-apk.yml ✗ (BAD - DELETED)
   - Uses upload-artifact@v3 (DEPRECATED!)
   - Uses old EAS build method
   - GitHub was running THIS one!

========================================
   THE FIX
========================================

I deleted the old build-apk.yml file.

Now GitHub will ONLY use build-android.yml
which has all the correct v4 actions!

========================================
   RUN THIS NOW
========================================

👉 🔥_DELETE_OLD_WORKFLOW.bat

This will:
1. Remove the old workflow from git
2. Commit the deletion
3. Push to GitHub
4. Trigger a new build with v4!

========================================
   WHAT WILL HAPPEN
========================================

After running the bat file:

1. GitHub will delete build-apk.yml
2. Only build-android.yml will remain
3. A new build will start automatically
4. This time it will use v4 (not v3!)
5. No more deprecation error!

========================================
   NEXT STEPS
========================================

1. Run: 🔥_DELETE_OLD_WORKFLOW.bat

2. Go to: https://github.com/Jpsolutionz/new/actions

3. Wait for new build to start

4. If it fails with a DIFFERENT error:
   - Click on the failed build
   - Look for step with red X
   - Tell me the new error

Possible next errors:
- "expo: command not found"
- "npm ERR! code ERESOLVE"
- "Android folder not found"
- "Gradle build failed"

But the v3 artifact error will be GONE!
