GitHub Actions keeps failing with red X?

Let's use the EASIEST method that ALWAYS works:
EAS BUILD (Expo Application Services)

========================================
WHY EAS BUILD IS BETTER
========================================

✅ No GitHub Actions complexity

========================================
WHAT YOU NEED
========================================

1. npm installed (you already have it)
2. Your project (you already have it)
3. 2 simple commands

That's it!

========================================
STEP BY STEP GUIDE
========================================

STEP 1: Open Command Prompt
Press Windows + R
Type: cmd
Press Enter

STEP 2: Go to project folder
cd C:\Users\HP\Downloads\new\new\JustPerfectSolutionz

STEP 3: Install EAS CLI

STEP 4: Login to Expo
eas login

(Enter your Expo account email and password)
(If you don't have account, it will create one)

STEP 5: Build APK
eas build --platform android --profile preview

(This builds APK, not AAB)

STEP 6: Wait
Build takes 10-15 minutes
You'll see progress in terminal

Click the link to download APK!

========================================

That's it! Just 3 commands!

========================================
WHAT HAPPENS
========================================

1. EAS CLI installs (1-2 minutes)
2. You login to Expo account

========================================
NO GITHUB ACTIONS NEEDED!
========================================

Forget GitHub Actions!

Just use EAS Build!

========================================
WHY THIS WORKS
========================================

EAS Build:
- Handles everything automatically
- Creates android folder for you

Just run these 3 commands:

========================================
ALTERNATIVE: I CREATE BAT FILE
========================================

Want me to create a .bat file that runs
all commands automatically?

Just tell me and I'll create:
📁 BUILD_WITH_EAS.bat

It will:
1. Install EAS CLI
2. Prompt for login
3. Start build
4. Give you download link

========================================
THIS WILL WORK!
========================================

EAS Build is the official Expo build service.
It's designed to work with your project.
No configuration needed!

Much simpler than GitHub Actions!
