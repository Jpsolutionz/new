COMPARISON
========================================

BUILDING ON YOUR PC:
❌ Need npm installed
❌ Need CLI installed
❌ Need android folder

❌ Takes 30+ minutes
❌ Uses your PC resources

YOUR CURRENT SITUATION
========================================

YOU SAID:
- "No i need only git not expo"
- "without cli is there is any possible"

SOLUTION:
You CAN use Expo WITHOUT installing it!
Just use Expo's CLOUD BUILD service!

NO EXPO ON YOUR PC!
Just use their website to build!

========================================
TWO OPTIONS (BOTH NO CLI)
========================================

OPTION 1: Expo Cloud Build
- Go to expo.dev website
- Click "Build"
- Download APK
- NO CLI NEEDED

OPTION 2: GitHub Actions
- Push workflow file
- GitHub builds APK

- NO CLI NEEDED ON YOUR PC
  (GitHub uses CLI in cloud)

========================================
WHICH ONE?
========================================

EASIEST: Option 1 (Expo Cloud)
- Just click in browser
- No setup needed
- Works right now

AUTOMATIC: Option 2 (GitHub Actions)
- Builds on every push
- Already set up
- Just push workflow

========================================
NEXT STEP
========================================
