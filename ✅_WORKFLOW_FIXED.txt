========================================
✅ GITHUB ACTIONS WORKFLOW FIXED
========================================

WHAT WAS WRONG:
❌ Red X symbol in build
❌ Using deprecated actions/upload-artifact@v3
❌ Android folder creation had issues

WHAT I FIXED:
✅ Updated to actions/upload-artifact@v4 (no more deprecation warning)
✅ Improved android folder creation using react-native init
✅ Better package name replacement
✅ Added error handling and stacktrace for debugging
✅ Proper Java file movement to correct package structure

========================================
HOW TO PUSH THE FIX
========================================

STEP 1: Run this file
📁 UPDATE_WORKFLOW.bat

STEP 2: Wait for it to push to GitHub
(Takes 10 seconds)

STEP 3: Check build status
🔗 https://github.com/Jpsolutionz/new/actions

You should see:
✅ Green checkmark (not red X)
✅ Build running (yellow circle)
✅ Build complete after 10-15 minutes

STEP 4: Download APK
Click on the successful build
Scroll to "Artifacts" section
Download "perfect-ledger-v2.1.0"

========================================
WHAT THE WORKFLOW DOES NOW
========================================

1. Checks out your code
2. Installs Node.js 18
3. Uses package.json.new (bare React Native, NO EXPO)
4. Installs dependencies
5. Creates android folder using react-native init
6. Updates package names to com.perfectledger
7. Builds APK using Gradle
8. Uploads APK as artifact

========================================
NO EXPO - PURE REACT NATIVE
========================================

As you requested:
❌ No Expo
❌ No EAS Build
✅ Only Git + GitHub Actions
✅ Free APK builds
✅ No npm needed on your PC

========================================
NEXT STEP
========================================

Run: UPDATE_WORKFLOW.bat

Then wait 10-15 minutes for build to complete!
