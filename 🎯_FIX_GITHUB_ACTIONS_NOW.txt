========================================
🎯 WHY YOU SEE "GET STARTED WITH GITHUB ACTIONS"
========================================

You successfully pushed your code to GitHub! ✅

But GitHub doesn't see the workflow file yet.

This happens because:
- The .github folder might not have been pushed
- OR GitHub needs a trigger to detect it

========================================
✅ EASIEST SOLUTION: CREATE ON GITHUB DIRECTLY
========================================

This is the FASTEST way (5 minutes):

STEP 1: Open your browser
--------------------------
Go to: https://github.com/Jpsolutionz/new


STEP 2: Click "Actions" tab
--------------------------
Look at the top menu:
Code | Issues | Pull requests | Actions

Click "Actions"


STEP 3: Click "set up a workflow yourself"
--------------------------
You'll see a blue link that says:
"set up a workflow yourself →"

Click it


STEP 4: Delete everything and paste this
--------------------------
Delete all the text in the editor

Then copy and paste this ENTIRE code:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
name: Build Android APK

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
    
    - name: Setup Java JDK
      uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        distribution: 'temurin'
        java-version: '17'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
    
    - name: Make Gradlew executable
      run: chmod +x android/gradlew
    
    - name: Build Android Release APK
      run: |
        cd android
        ./gradlew assembleRelease --no-daemon
    
    - name: Upload APK
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: app-release
        path: android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


STEP 5: Commit the workflow
--------------------------
1. Click green "Commit changes" button (top right)
2. A popup appears
3. Click green "Commit changes" button again


STEP 6: Watch it build!
--------------------------
1. You'll be redirected to the Actions page
2. You'll see "Build Android APK" running
3. Wait 10-15 minutes
4. When done, scroll down to "Artifacts"
5. Click "app-release" to download your APK!

========================================
📱 DOWNLOAD YOUR APK
========================================

After the build completes:

1. Go to: https://github.com/Jpsolutionz/new/actions

2. Click on the latest workflow run
   (It will have a green checkmark ✓)

3. Scroll down to "Artifacts" section

4. Click "app-release" to download

5. Extract the ZIP file

6. You'll find: app-release.apk

7. Transfer to your phone and install!

========================================
⏱️ HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?
========================================

First build: 10-15 minutes
(GitHub needs to download everything)

Later builds: 5-10 minutes
(GitHub caches dependencies)

You can close the browser and come back later!

========================================
🌐 MEANWHILE: USE THE WEB APP!
========================================

While waiting for the APK, use the web app:

URL: https://13.60.249.27
Login: admin@test.com / admin123

✓ Works on phone browser
✓ Works on tablet browser
✓ Works on PC browser
✓ All features available
✓ No installation needed

Just open the URL in your phone's browser!

========================================
🔄 TRIGGER BUILD MANUALLY (OPTIONAL)
========================================

After creating the workflow, you can trigger builds
without making code changes:

1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click "Build Android APK" (left sidebar)
3. Click "Run workflow" button (right side)
4. Click green "Run workflow" button
5. Build starts immediately!

========================================
❓ WHAT IF BUILD FAILS?
========================================

If the build fails, it's likely because:

1. package.json needs to be renamed
   - You have "package.json.new"
   - It needs to be "package.json"

2. Android folder might be missing files

Don't worry! We can fix it. Just let me know
if you see any errors.
