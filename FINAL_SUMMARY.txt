ABOUT "WELCOME TO PULL REQUEST"
========================================

This is normal! You're seeing the Pull Requests tab.

The GitHub Actions workflow will trigger automatically
when the repository recognizes the workflow file.

========================================
SOLUTION - WHAT TO DO NOW
========================================

The easiest solution is to use the WEB APP while
we wait for GitHub to process the workflow:

🌐 WEB APP (WORKS NOW):
   URL: https://13.60.249.27
   Login: admin@test.com / admin123
   
   ✓ All features working
   ✓ Create ledgers
   ✓ View ledgers
   ✓ Download PDF
   ✓ Delete ledgers
   ✓ Works on phone, tablet, PC

========================================
ALTERNATIVE: CHECK GITHUB ACTIONS
========================================

1. Go to: https://github.com/Jpsolutionz/new

2. Look for tabs at the top:
   Code | Issues | Pull requests | Actions
   
3. Click "Actions"

4. If you see workflows, great!
   If not, the workflow will trigger on next push.

========================================
TO TRIGGER BUILD MANUALLY
========================================

Make a small change and push again:

1. Open Command Prompt

2. Go to project:
   cd C:\Users\HP\Downloads\new\new\JustPerfectSolutionz

3. Make a small change:
   echo. >> README.md

4. Push again:
   git add .
   git commit -m "Trigger build"
   git push

This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow!

========================================
WHAT WE ACHIEVED TODAY

✅ Fixed network request failed error
✅ Set up HTTPS on EC2 server
✅ Deployed web app
✅ Updated mobile app code to use HTTPS
✅ Removed Expo dependencies
