========================================
   YOU'RE RIGHT! HERE'S THE PROBLEM
========================================

WHAT YOU DISCOVERED:
✓ All GitHub builds are from Feb 28, 2026
✓ NO builds from today (March 1, 2026)
✓ This means the updated workflow hasn't been pushed yet!

========================================
   WHY THIS HAPPENED
========================================

The workflow file exists on your PC:
📁 .github/workflows/build-android.yml

But it's NOT on GitHub yet!
That's why GitHub is still using the OLD workflow from Feb 28.

========================================
   SOLUTION (VERY SIMPLE)
========================================

Run this file:
👉 PUSH_WORKFLOW_TO_GITHUB.bat

This will:
1. Add the workflow file to git
2. Commit it
3. Push it to GitHub

Then GitHub will automatically start a NEW build!

========================================
   AFTER RUNNING THE BAT FILE
========================================

1. Go to: https://github.com/Jpsolutionz/new/actions

2. Refresh the page

3. You'll see a NEW build starting (today's date!)

4. Wait 10-15 minutes for it to complete

5. If it fails, click on it to see the error

========================================
   WHAT TO LOOK FOR IF IT FAILS
========================================

When you click on the failed build, you'll see steps like:
- ✓ Checkout code (green checkmark)
- ✓ Setup Node.js (green checkmark)
- ✓ Install dependencies (green checkmark)
- ❌ Setup Expo and create Android folder (RED X)

The step with RED X is where it failed!
Click on it to see the error message.

Then tell me:
- Which step has the red X?
- What's the error message?

========================================
   RUN THIS NOW
========================================

👉 PUSH_WORKFLOW_TO_GITHUB.bat

Then check GitHub Actions page!
