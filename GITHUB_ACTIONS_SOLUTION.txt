🎯 GITHUB ACTIONS - WHY YOU SEE "GET STARTED"
========================================

You're seeing "Get started with GitHub Actions" because
GitHub hasn't detected the workflow file yet.

This can happen if:
1. The .github folder wasn't pushed
2. GitHub needs a trigger to detect it
3. The workflow file is in the wrong location

========================================
✅ SOLUTION 1: FORCE PUSH .GITHUB FOLDER
========================================

Run this file:
📁 CHECK_GITHUB_WORKFLOW.bat

It will:
1. Check if workflow file exists
2. Force add .github folder
3. Commit and push
4. Trigger GitHub Actions

========================================
✅ SOLUTION 2: CREATE WORKFLOW ON GITHUB
========================================

If Solution 1 doesn't work, create it directly on GitHub:

1. Go to: https://github.com/Jpsolutionz/new

2. Click "Actions" tab

3. Click "set up a workflow yourself"

4. Replace everything with this:

---START COPY FROM HERE---
name: Build Android APK

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
    
    - name: Setup Java JDK
      uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        distribution: 'temurin'
        java-version: '17'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
    
    - name: Make Gradlew executable
      run: chmod +x android/gradlew
    
    - name: Build Android Release APK
      run: |
        cd android
        ./gradlew assembleRelease --no-daemon
    
    - name: Upload APK
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: app-release
        path: android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
---END COPY---

5. Click "Commit changes"

6. The workflow will start running immediately!

========================================
✅ SOLUTION 3: USE WEB APP (WORKS NOW!)
========================================

While waiting for GitHub Actions, use the web app:

🌐 URL: https://13.60.249.27
👤 Login: admin@test.com / admin123

✓ Works on phone, tablet, PC
✓ All features available
✓ No installation needed
✓ No waiting for builds

========================================
📋 STEP-BY-STEP: CREATE WORKFLOW ON GITHUB
========================================

1. Open browser
2. Go to: https://github.com/Jpsolutionz/new
3. Click "Actions" tab (top menu)
4. Click "set up a workflow yourself" (blue link)
5. Delete everything in the editor
6. Copy the workflow code above
7. Paste it
8. Click "Commit changes" (green button)
9. Click "Commit changes" again (confirm)
10. Wait 2 minutes
11. Refresh the Actions page
12. You'll see the build running!

========================================
🎯 RECOMMENDED APPROACH
========================================

TRY THIS ORDER:

1. Run CHECK_GITHUB_WORKFLOW.bat
   (Fastest - 2 minutes)

2. If that doesn't work, create workflow on GitHub
   (Easy - 5 minutes)

3. While waiting, use the web app
   (Works immediately!)

========================================
❓ WHY GITHUB ACTIONS IS BETTER
========================================

✓ Completely FREE forever
✓ Automatic builds on every push
✓ No local setup needed
✓ Professional CI/CD
✓ Build history
✓ Download APK anytime
✓ No Expo account needed
✓ No build limits

========================================
📱 AFTER BUILD COMPLETES
========================================

1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click on the workflow run
3. Scroll down to "Artifacts"
4. Click "app-release" to download
5. Extract the ZIP
6. Install the APK on your phone

========================================
⏱️ BUILD TIME
========================================

First build: 10-15 minutes
Later builds: 5-10 minutes

GitHub Actions runs on powerful servers,
so it's faster than building locally!

========================================
🎉 WHAT YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED
========================================

✅ Removed Expo (no more limits!)
✅ Set up professional CI/CD
✅ Code on GitHub (version control)
✅ HTTPS server running
✅ Web app deployed and working
✅ Mobile app code updated

You're using industry-standard tools now!

========================================
💡 QUICK TIP
========================================

If you want to trigger a build manually:

1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click "Build Android APK" (left side)
3. Click "Run workflow" (right side)
4. Click green "Run workflow" button

This works even without making code changes!

========================================
📞 CURRENT STATUS
========================================

✅ Code: On GitHub
✅ Workflow: Created locally
❓ GitHub: Needs to detect workflow

NEXT STEP: Run CHECK_GITHUB_WORKFLOW.bat
