  TEST BACKEND CONNECTION
========================================================================

To verify your backend is running and accessible:

1. Make sure backend is running:
   - Go to: C:\Users\HP\Downloads\new\new\ledger-app\ledger-backend-fastapi
   - Run: KILL_PYTHON_AND_START.bat
   - Wait for "Application startup complete"

2. Test from your phone's browser:
   - Open browser on your phone
   - Go to: http://10.126.93.209:8080/docs
   - You should see the FastAPI Swagger UI

3. If step 2 fails:
   - Your phone can't reach the backend
   - Check if both devices are on the same WiFi network
   - Check Windows Firewall settings

4. Test registration from Swagger UI:
   - Click on "POST /api/v1/auth/register"
   - Click "Try it out"
   - Enter:
     {
       "name": "Test User",
       "email": "test@example.com",
       "password": "test123",
       "role": "user"
     }
   - Click "Execute"
   - Should return 200 OK with a token

5. Common errors:
   - "Network request failed" = Backend not reachable
   - "User already exists" = Try different email
   - "API request failed" = Backend error (check backend console)
