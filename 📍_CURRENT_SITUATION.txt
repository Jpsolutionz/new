========================================
   CURRENT SITUATION
========================================

WHAT'S HAPPENING:
You have 2 workflows running on GitHub:

1. build-android.yml ✓ (The one we want)
   - Uses expo prebuild
   - Failed after 10m 41s
   - Error: "Process completed with exit code 1"
   - Need to see detailed error

2. build-with-expo.yml ✗ (Don't need this)
   - Uses EAS build
   - Needs EXPO_TOKEN secret
   - Failing with cache warnings

========================================
   WHAT WE NEED TO DO
========================================

STEP 1: See the actual error from build-android.yml
- Click on build #9
- Click on the "build" step (red circle)
- Scroll down to see the error message
- Tell me what it says

STEP 2: Disable build-with-expo.yml
- We don't need this workflow
- It's causing confusion
- We'll delete or disable it

========================================
   MOST LIKELY ERRORS
========================================

Based on "exit code 1", it could be:

ERROR 1: npm install failed
- Dependency conflict
- Missing package

ERROR 2: expo prebuild failed

- Android folder creation failed

ERROR 3: Gradle build failed
- Java/Android build error
- Missing dependencies

ERROR 4: No android folder

========================================
   NEXT STEP
========================================

Click on build #9 (build-android.yml)
Then click on the "build" step
Copy the error message and tell me!
