🔍 WHERE IS THE BUILD BUTTON?
========================================

You asked: "where is the build button"

ANSWER: It depends on if you have a project yet!

========================================
SCENARIO 1: FIRST TIME (NO PROJECT)
========================================

When you go to expo.dev for the first time:

STEP 1: Go to https://expo.dev
You'll see:
- "Sign In" button (top right)
- "Get Started" button

STEP 2: Click "Sign In"
Choose: "Continue with GitHub"

STEP 3: After signing in
You'll see: "Projects" page
It will be EMPTY (no projects yet)

STEP 4: Create a project FIRST
Click: "Create a project" button
OR
Click: "New Project" button

STEP 5: Choose import method
- "Import from GitHub" ← Choose this!
- Select: Jpsolutionz/new

STEP 6: NOW you'll see Build button!
After project is created, you'll see:
- "Builds" tab (click this)
- "Create a build" button ← THIS IS IT!

========================================
SCENARIO 2: PROJECT ALREADY EXISTS
========================================

If you already created a project:

STEP 1: Go to https://expo.dev
STEP 2: Click "Projects" (top menu)
STEP 3: Click on your project name
STEP 4: Click "Builds" tab (left sidebar)
STEP 5: Click "Create a build" button ← HERE!

========================================
PROBLEM: CAN'T FIND BUILD BUTTON?
========================================

REASON 1: No project created yet
SOLUTION: Create project first!
- Click "Create a project"
- Import from GitHub

REASON 2: Wrong page
SOLUTION: Click "Builds" tab
- Look at left sidebar
- Click "Builds"

REASON 3: Not signed in
SOLUTION: Sign in first
- Click "Sign In"
- Use GitHub

========================================
ALTERNATIVE: USE EAS CLI
========================================

If you can't find the Build button on website,
you can use EAS CLI instead:

STEP 1: Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

STEP 2: Login
eas login

STEP 3: Build
eas build --platform android

But this needs npm installed!

========================================
EASIEST SOLUTION
========================================

Since you're having trouble finding the
Build button, let me give you an even
EASIER option:

USE GITHUB ACTIONS INSTEAD!

WHY?
✅ No need to find Build button
✅ No need to navigate Expo website
✅ Just push code and wait
✅ Already set up for you!

HOW?
1. Run: UPDATE_WORKFLOW.bat
2. Wait 10-15 minutes
3. Download APK from GitHub

This is SIMPLER than Expo website!

========================================
MY RECOMMENDATION NOW
========================================

Since you're asking "where is build button",
it seems Expo website is confusing.

BETTER OPTION: Use GitHub Actions!

ADVANTAGES:
✅ No website navigation needed
✅ No "find the button" confusion
✅ Just run one .bat file
✅ Automatic builds
✅ Already configured

JUST RUN THIS:
📁 UPDATE_WORKFLOW.bat

Then go to:
🔗 https://github.com/Jpsolutionz/new/actions

You'll see the build running!
Download APK when done!

========================================
WHICH DO YOU PREFER?
========================================

A) Try Expo website again
   → I'll create detailed screenshots guide

B) Use GitHub Actions (easier)
   → Just run UPDATE_WORKFLOW.bat

Tell me A or B!

I recommend B - it's simpler!
